# PFDAProject2020

For this project I had to create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
my choosing.

In my case, I chose the natural real-world phenomenon of tornadoes in Kansas, USA

Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, I  modeled and synthesised my data using Python by using the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project I needed to:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.



How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1) Open the terminal on your Mac or PC
2) Navigate to the folder where your project is stored
3) Type Jupyter Notebook and press ‘Enter’
4) A browser will appear that will show a .ipynb document
5) Double-click on the .ipynb document and another tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook
6) Begin reading/working in your Jupyter Notebook
